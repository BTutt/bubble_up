Bubble_Up! V1.0
=========

Bubble_Up is an easy way to display a pop up information bubble on any web page. The bubble becomes visible when a user places the mouse over (or clicks/touches) a web page element (image, span, div, etc.). When the mouse is removed from the area, the bubble disapears. Or the user can close the bubble with a touch/click on the close window button. The text, colors, and size can be easily configured.
